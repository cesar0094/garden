title: Become antifragile with your beliefs
type: text/x-markdown

Evidence that contradicts your beliefs should make you grow because you have the opportunity to believe something that is "less wrong". If we can follow this practice, the more we test our beliefs, the more we benefit.

In practice, it is hard to let go of our beliefs because we attach our identity to them and our lives may be based on them. They are not just a sentence in our heads but the influences behind our behavior.
