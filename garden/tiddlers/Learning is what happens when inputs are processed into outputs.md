Look at how language skills are measured. Tests do not only score reading and listening, they also evaluate writing and speaking. As many second language learners know, understanding a language is much easier than speaking a language.

This means writing an essay, doing a project, teaching a course, or even just taking [[ACID notes|Aim to write ACID notes]].
