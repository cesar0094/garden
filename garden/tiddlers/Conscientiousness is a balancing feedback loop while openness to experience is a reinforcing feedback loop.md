If we seek to have both, we should [[balance between openness to new ideas and skepticism|Balance between openness to new ideas and skepticism]].

One is creating order, the other is creating chaos. Together they create progress and meaning. [[Balancing feedback loops maintain order while reinforcing feedback loops create chaos]].

You should remain skeptic and filter ideas that don't pass your filters while also remaining open-minded to new ones so you can explore unknown paths.

A purely conscientious life is the equivalent of a system optimized for stability. Chaos and unpredictability are part of life, so stability breaks easily. [[Seek to be resilient to changes and not stable over time]]. If you want to go the extra mile, [[become antifragile with your beliefs|Become antifragile with your beliefs]].

If you are open to every idea, there will be an infinite number of paths to explore. Information overload prevents any progress.

A purely open-to-experience life is similar to having a high-level of mutation in a population. There is a threshold for how much mutation a population can tolerate before no evolution is seen. Randomness in traits can be so high that selection is purely by chance rather than fitness.
