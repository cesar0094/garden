It is common to forget that every thought is an interpretation that reduces the complexity of the real world into something we can grasp and manipulate. Our ideas and models should take into account uncertainty and hidden relationships. Even better, we can build them to benefit from latent chaos, making them antifragile.

Every theory, equation, and analysis is a limited version of reality. We hold maps in our minds but they are not the territory.

We are constantly building mental models of the reality we see and [[we see only what we can talk about|We see only what we can talk about]], meaning our reality is constrained by what we are able to perceive. By the same token, our reality expands along with our ability to see and perceive.
