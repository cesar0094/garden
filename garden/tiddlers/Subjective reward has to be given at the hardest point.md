Engaging in an activity that requires effort releases epinephrine. There’s a level of epinephrine that the body accepts and after that we want to quit. A release of dopamine at this point raises our tolerance for stress allowing us to continue more.

Furthermore, the brain needs a refreshing period after a lot of effort. That’s when serotonin is released. It makes us feel safe and worthy. It gives meaning to all the dopamine that has been driving us.
