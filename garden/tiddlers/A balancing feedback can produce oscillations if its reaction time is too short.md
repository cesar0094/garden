Since any system has delays in its feedback loops, a balancing feedback can cause oscillations if it is reacting too quickly because is not allowing the system to stabilize.

We have to allow the effects of the balancing feedback loop to show in the system in order to know its resulting state.

It is the consequence of [[feedback loops causing changes in a future state based on a past state|Feedback loops cause changes in a future state based on a past state]].
